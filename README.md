## 📌 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Loaded Dimension Tables  
From **Analysis.xlsx**, the following sheets were added to the **Power Pivot Data Model**:  
- `Dim_Stores` → Stores Table  
- `Dim_Products` → Products Table  
- `Dim_Dates` → Date Table  

---

### 2️⃣ Loaded Fact Table  
- From **SalesData.xlsx**, imported the **Sales** sheet into **Power Pivot**.  
- This acted as the **Fact Table** for the analysis.  

---

### 3️⃣ Adjusted Data Types  
- Set `Sales[DateID]` → **Date**  
- Set `Dim_Dates[Date]` → **Date**  

---

### 4️⃣ Marked Date Table  
- From the **Design tab**, marked `Dim_Dates` as the **Date Table** using the `Date` column.  
- Enabled usage of **DAX Time Intelligence Functions**.  

---

### 5️⃣ Sorted Columns  
- Sorted `Month` by `MonthNum` → Ensured correct order (*Jan, Feb, Mar, …*).  
- Sorted `WeekDay` by `WeekDayNum` → Ensured correct order (*Mon, Tue, …*).  

---

### 6️⃣ Created Relationships  
In **Diagram View**, relationships were set as follows:  
- `Sales[ProductID]` → `Dim_Products[SKU]`  
- `Sales[StoreID]` → `Dim_Stores[Store ID]`  
- `Sales[DateID]` → `Dim_Dates[Date]`  
- `Sales[ManagerID]` → `Dim_Managers[ManagerID]`  

---

### 7️⃣ Power Query Transformation (Dim_Managers)  
The **Managers Table** contained duplicate rows, so it was transformed in **Power Query** before loading into the Model:  
- Changed column data types  
- Removed duplicates on `ManagerID`  
- Dropped unnecessary column `Date Left Company`  
- Merged with `Dim_Commission` on `Time in Service = Years`  
- Expanded the `Commission` column from the merged table  
- Changed `Commission` type to **Percentage**  
- Loaded cleaned `Dim_Managers` into the **Data Model**  
- Created relationship: `Sales[ManagerID]` → `Dim_Managers[ManagerID]`  

---

### 8️⃣ DAX Calculations  

#### 🔹 Calculated Columns  

**Store Type (Friendly Names)**  
```DAX
StoreTypeName =
    SWITCH([Store Type],
        "SM", "SMALL",
        "MED", "MEDIUM",
        "WAREHOUSE", "WAREHOUSE",
        "OTHER"
    )
```  

**Gross Profit ($)**  
```DAX
MarginDollars = [Units Sold] * [UnitPrice] * [RawMargin]
```  

---

#### 🔹 Measures  

**Margin Amount**  
```DAX
MarginAmt := SUM(Sales[MarginDollars])
```  

**Units Sold**  
```DAX
Units := SUM(Sales[Units Sold])
```  

**Total Sales**  
```DAX
Sales := SUMX(Sales, [Units Sold] * [UnitPrice])
```  

**Margin Percentage**  
```DAX
MarginPct := [MarginAmt] / [Sales]
```  

**Sales as % of Total (by Dates)**  
```DAX
SalesPctOfTotalDates :=
VAR TotalSales = CALCULATE([Sales], ALLSELECTED(Dim_Dates))
RETURN [Sales] / TotalSales
```  

**Prior Year Sales**  
```DAX
SalesPY := CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Dates[Date]))
```  

**Sales vs Prior Year %**  
```DAX
SalesVsPY :=
    DIVIDE(([Sales] - [SalesPY]), [SalesPY], "NA")
```
